            I was always fascinated with websites ever since I was a kid
            watching videos on youtube.com, searching things up on google.com,
            playing games on multiple websites, and more. I loved how technology
            made the ideas of websites come to life, but I never really
            understood how it was made. I knew I wanted to be a part of the
            process for years, but I really haven&apos;t gotten my head engaged
            in it until August 2022.{' '}

            With the goal of creating my own professional website, I had decided
            to learn about HTML and CSS to start. These two technologies helped
            me to create a very basic website with limited functionality, but
            still looked decent. After that, I have devoted most of my time in
            mastering JavaScript and learning about Data Structures &
            Algorithms. After JavaScript was done, I am now using my time to
            learn the ins and outs of React and Tailwind CSS, which are the
            technologies being used to make this website.{' '}

          <p className='py-2 text-gray-300'>
            In my experience in being a front-end developer, I have loved all
            the technologies that I am using and how it&apos;s evolving my
            creativity and making me more efficient overall. I am now mastering
            my craft in front-end development and I am slowly going to dabble in
            the back-end to try to become a full-stack developer. But for now, I
            am loving Web Development and it really helps me to appreciate the
            product that I create in the end.
